# Yours-Cupid-Game-Code
# Yours, Cupid [MA1805 Autumn Final Project] 
## Game Theme 
My game is focused on the idea of love, through love letters and the concept of 'cupid'. I also looked into the concept of internet chat rooms, which in some ways can be thought to be the modern equivalent of traditional love letters.
## Description 
I intended to make a game inspired by the incredibly popular arcade game 'Space Invaders'. I wanted to make some changes to this concept, so that you would have to shoot at the 'invaders' (love letters) twice before gaining or losing points. The idea is that you are not meant to shoot at the love letters, which causes you to lose points, and you are meant to shoot at the broken hearts to gain points. I also replaced the 'spaceship' and 'bullet' shooters with a bow and arrow, which represents cupid.

I kept the game mechanics simple, as I was already aware that I had chosen a complex game to do and I am a beginner with coding in p5.js. 
## Aesthetics
To stick with the theme of cupid and love, I have chosen pink as the main colour for this project. I found this most fitting as I wanted to keep the game light hearted and enjoyable.
I would have also liked to add a retro arcade-style font to the code, but I struggled with this, I think that this would have also been a good addition to my game.

I have also made all of the art for my game myself, on Canva. I found this very time consuming and challenging as I had chosen a pixel art style, which took time to make properly. However, I am happy I chose to do this as I feel it has added to the aesthetics of the game and adding my own personal art style to this project was important to me. 
## Improvements
I am aware that this game has a lot that I could have done better. I have had a lot of trouble with actually getting it to load the way I wanted it to after the start page. I have managed to make an instructions page that functions, but once you click 'start', the love letters do not generate the way I wanted them to. I'm still not sure why this has happened, as I used a previously created space invaders code as a starting point, which I added to, and the reference works as expected though mine does not.
